# Template for submission laboratory 1, 1dv610

## Checklist
  - [✅*] In my tokenizer there are no token types or reg-exp. These are in my test project because they are created by the user. 
  - [✅] I have written all the code and reflections myself. I have not used other people's code to solve the task.
  - [✅] My test results are written based on testing performed (and not theoretically, it should work :))
  - [✅] The only static methods or functions outside of classes that I have are to start my test application ex main (java).
  - [✅] The only libraries and ready-made classes used are those that must be used (or used to test the module).

*  The END token (incl. regexp) is created in my app. This had to be done to manage handling the token in a controlled way.

## Self-assessment and goals
  - [ ] I'm not done because I know I'm missing something. Then do not submit!
  - [ ] I strive with this submission approved grade (E-D)
    - [✅] Most test cases work
    - [✅] The code is ready for reuse
    - [✅] All code and history are in git
    - [✅] The code quality requirements are met
    - [ ] Reflection is written
  - [ ] With this submission, I strive for higher grades (C-B) and consider myself to meet all the additional requirements for this.
    - [✅] All test cases are written
    - [ ] Own test cases for Maximum munch and edge cases
    - [✅] Test cases are automated
    - [ ] There is a clear description of how to use the module (in git)
    - [ ] The code quality requirements are varied
  - [✅] I strive for the highest grade (A) with this submission

Clarification: The examiner will give grades regardless of what you think.

## Reuse
Describe how you adapted your code and instructions for another programmer to use your tokenizer. If you have written instructions for your user link to these. If not, describe here what someone should do to use your code with their own grammar.

## Description of my code
Describe your code at a high level of abstraction. A brief description of your most important classes and methods. Feel free to create a class diagram as an image.

## How I tested
Describe how you came to the conclusion that your code works.

### Test cases
List the individual test cases. **Bold** things that you have filled in yourself. One line per test case.

| Name      | Grammar | String | Sequence | Expected Active Token | PASS/FAIL |
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
|           |           |        |         |              | ✅       |

You can comment if your tokenizer differs slightly from the default.

### Test cases for higher grade

List the individual test cases. One row per test case.
| Name      | Grammar | String | Sequence | Expected Active Token | PASS/FAIL |
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
|           |           |        |         |              | ✅        |

## Code quality requirements

**Bold** the "rules" used from CC. You can deviate from table format if you want. Create direct links to your code where appropriate.

### Naming

| Name and explanation  | Reflection                                   |
| -------------------  | ---------------------------------------------|

### Funktioner

| Method name and explanation (no. lines excl. ws)  |                                  |
| -------------------  | ---------------------------------------------|
|                      |                                              |

## Laboratory reflection
Reflect on the task from a code quality perspective. Use concepts from the book.
